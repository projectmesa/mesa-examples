Contributing
=========================

As an open source project, Mesa welcomes contributions of many forms, and from beginners to experts. 

Contributions can a full model or it could one of the following to an existing model: 

- Code patches
- Bug reports and patch reviews
- New features
- Documentation improvements
- Tutorials

No contribution is too small. Although, contributions can be too big, so let's
discuss via `Matrix`_ OR via `an issue`_.

.. _`Mesa discussions`: https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa/discussions
.. _`Matrix`: https://matrix.to/#/#project-mesa:matrix.org`
.. _`an issue` : https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa-examples/issues

**To submit a contribution**

- Create a ticket for the item that you are working on.
- Fork the mesa-examples repository.
- `Clone your repository`_ from Github to your machine.
- Create a new branch in your fork: ``git checkout -b BRANCH_NAME``
- Run ``git config pull.rebase true``. This prevents messy merge commits when updating your branch on top of Mesa main branch.
- If you are using the existing Mesa version that a model might be pinned to, then you will want to run ``pip install -r requirements.txt`` from inside the example folder you are working with. If you are making changes using the main repo or other version, do not install the version in the requirements file & make sure to update if the example is pinned.
- Git add the new files and files with changes: ``git add FILE_NAME``
- Git commit your changes with a meaningful message: ``git commit -m "Fix issue X"``
- Make sure that your submission passes the `GH Actions build`_. See "Testing and Standards below" to be able to run these locally.
- Make sure that your code is formatted according to `the black`_ standard (you can do it via `pre-commit`_).
- Push your changes to your fork on Github: ``git push origin NAME_OF_BRANCH``.
- `Create a pull request`_.
- Describe the change w/ ticket number(s) that the code fixes.
- Format your commit message as per `Tim Pope's guideline`_.

Testing and Code Standards
--------

As part of our contribution process, we practice continuous integration and use GH Actions to help enforce best practices.

If you're changing previous Mesa features, please make sure of the following:

- Your changes pass our style standards.
- Your changes don't break the models or your changes include updated models.

To ensure that your submission will not break the build, you will need to install Flake8 and pytest.

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install flake8 pytest pytest-cov

With respect to code standards, we follow `PEP8`_ and the `Google Style Guide`_. We recommend to use `black`_ as an automated code formatter. You can automatically format your code using `pre-commit`_, which will prevent `git commit` of unstyled code and will automatically apply black style so you can immediately re-run `git commit`. To set up pre-commit run the following commands:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install pre-commit
    pre-commit install

You should no longer have to worry about code formatting. If still in doubt you may run the following command. If the command generates errors, fix all errors that are returned.

.. code-block:: bash

    flake8 . --ignore=F403,E501,E123,E128,W504,W503 --exclude=docs,build
