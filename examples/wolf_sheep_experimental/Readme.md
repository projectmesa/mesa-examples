# Wolf-Sheep Experimental Model

This is an experimental implementation of the Wolf-Sheep Predation Model, which simulates the dynamics of predator-prey interactions between wolves and sheep, including factors such as energy expenditure, reproduction, and grass regrowth.

## Summary

## Summary

This model consists of three agent types: wolves, sheep, and grass patches. The wolves and sheep wander around the grid at random, expending energy as they move. Sheep eat fully grown grass to replenish energy, while wolves eat sheep if they occupy the same cell. Both species reproduce asexually with a certain probability if they have sufficient energy, splitting their energy with offspring. The grass regrows after a set time if enabled in the model. Agents die if their energy depletes.

The model tests and demonstrates several Mesa concepts and features:
 - MultiGrid for spatial representation.
 - Multiple agent types (wolves, sheep, grass patches).
 - Agent portrayal with different shapes and colors.
 - Agents inheriting behavior (random movement) from an abstract parent.
 - Model composition using multiple files.
 - Dynamic agent addition and removal from the schedule.
 - Data collection and visualization using SolaraViz.
 - Experimental feature: ABMSimulator

## Installation

To install the dependencies use pip and the requirements.txt in this directory. e.g.

```
    # First, we clone the Mesa repo
    $ git clone https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa-examples.git
    $ cd mesa
    # Then we cd to the example directory
    $ cd examples/wolf_sheep_experimental
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Run

You can run the batch model directly by executing the `app.py` file. e.g.

Then open your browser to [http://127.0.0.1:8521/](http://127.0.0.1:8521/) and press Reset, then Run.

```
    solara run app.py
```
