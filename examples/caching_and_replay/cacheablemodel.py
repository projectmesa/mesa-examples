    """A wrapper around the original Schelling model to make the simulation cacheable

    "cacheable".
    From outside, a CacheableSchelling instance can be treated like any
    regular Mesa model.
    The only difference is that the model will write the state of every simulation step
    to a cache file or when in replay mode use a given cache file to replay that cached
    simulation run."""
