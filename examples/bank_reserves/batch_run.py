The following code was adapted from the Bank Reserves model included in Netlogo

    Northwestern University, Evanston, IL.

This version of the model has a BatchRunner at the bottom. This
is for collecting data on parameter sweeps. It is not meant to
be run with run.py, since run.py starts up a server for visualization, which
isn't necessary for the BatchRunner. To run a parameter sweep, call
batch_run.py in the command line.

The BatchRunner is set up to collect step by step data of the model. It does
this by collecting the DataCollector object in a model_reporter (i.e. the
DataCollector is collecting itself every step).

The end result of the batch run will be a CSV file created in the same
directory from which Python was run. The CSV file will contain the data from
every step of every run.
