    This model is a Mesa implementation of the Bank Reserves model from NetLogo.
    It is a highly abstracted, simplified model of an economy, with only one
    type of agent and a single bank representing all banks in an economy. People
    (represented by circles) move randomly within the grid. If two or more people
    are on the same grid location, there is a 50% chance that they will trade with
    each other. If they trade, there is an equal chance of giving the other agent
    $5 or $2. A positive trade balance will be deposited in the bank as savings.
    If trading results in a negative balance, the agent will try to withdraw from
    its savings to cover the balance. If it does not have enough savings to cover
    the negative balance, it will take out a loan from the bank to cover the
    difference. The bank is required to keep a certain percentage of deposits as
    reserves and the bank's ability to loan at any given time is a function of
    the amount of deposits, its reserves, and its current total outstanding loan
    amount.
