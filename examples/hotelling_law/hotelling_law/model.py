# The main model class that sets up and runs the simulation.
class HotellingModel(Model):
    """
    A model simulating competition and pricing strategies among stores
    within a defined environment. This simulation
    explores the dynamics of market competition, specifically focusing
    on how pricing and location strategies affect
    market outcomes in accordance with Hotelling's Law.

    Parameters:
        N_stores (int): The number of store agents participating
        in the simulation.Each agent acts as an individual store competing
        in the market.
        width (int), height (int): The dimensions of the simulation grid.
        These dimensions define the size of the environment in which the
        store agents operate.
        mode (str): Defines the operation mode of the simulation,
        influencing agent behavior. The available modes are:
        - 'default': In this mode, agents have the ability to both move
        (if enabled) and adjust their pricing in response
        to market conditions.
        - 'pricing_only': Agents focus solely on adjusting their prices
        to optimize market positioning and do not move regardless of
        their mobility settings.
        - 'moving_only': Agents can change their locations if they are
        enabled to move but will not adjust their prices. This mode
        is useful for studying the effects of spatial distribution
        without pricing competition.
        consumer_preferences (str): Defines the consumer preferences
        influencing agent behavior. The available options are:
        - 'default': Consumers will choose store based on min proximity
        and price
        - 'proximity': Consumers choose store based on proximity
        - 'price': Consumers choose store based on min price
        mobility_rate (int): Represents the percentage of agents that
        are allowed to move in the simulation environment. This parameter
        is a percentage of the total number of agents (N),
        determining how many of them have the capability to relocate.
        For example, a mobility rate of 80 means 80% of the store agents
        can change their locations if the operation mode permits movement.
        This allows for the exploration of market dynamics under
        varying degrees of agent mobility.

    Key Components:
        HotellingModel: The class encapsulating the simulation environment,
        responsible for initializing the agents, setting up the grid,
        and managing data collection for analysis.
        compute_average_price(model),compute_total_revenue(model):
        Functions that calculate key economic metrics from the
        simulation data for analysis.

    The model leverages Mesa's framework capabilities to simulate agent
    interactions, environmental constraints,and the emergent phenomena
    resulting from individual agent strategies within the
    market context defined by Hotelling's Law.
